# **LoordsOfAnglee**
A game about leading a group of post-apocalyptic foxpeople to greatness.

# Installation
Depending on if you have 'pip' or 'pip3' as your PATH (fresh installs should be 'pip'), run the appropriate .bat file to install the project requirements. Then you can use the 'run.bat' file to play the game.

**Note: Currently, this project only works on Windows systems.**

# Gameplay
Currently, you can play the Nomad stage, where you forage, scavenge, loot, fish and hunt. You need to keep your group fed and watered, craft some items and manage your carry weight. More items, recipes, jobs, locations and balancing will be added in the near future.

# Navigation
The game is console-based and only uses the keyboard, no mouse is required. Numeric keys perform most actions on the menus, while alphabetical keys do things inside menus such as internal navigation, dropping items, changing modes etc.

Note, any time you see something like !drop_item!, don't worry, it just means there's a missing localisation key I haven't written yet.

# Details

**Assigning Workers**

Different leeani are good at different things. You'll want to select who you send for which tasks based on their VULPES skills.

V - Vitality: How fit the leeani is, for things like endurance running, and determines their max HP and damage reduction. (max HP and DR not in yet)  
U - Utility: How focused a leeani is on a given task, as well as a measure of how practically handy they are.  
L - Learning: The raw brainpower of this leeani, better for researching and knowledge of which berries are good to eat.  
P - Perception: Measures the keeness of a leeani's eyes, useful for hunting or spotting shiny things from a distance.  
E - Eloquence: How silver the leeani's tongue is. Makes negotiating and researching easier, and raises the trade bonus. (note, trade is not in yet)  
S - Strength: Does your leeani even lift? Quantifies their raw maahsels, useful for high-intensity work such as woodcutting or mining.  

Each job has two stats it benefits from, a 'major' stat and a 'minor' stat. This affects things like how many resources they gain from a job, or how quickly they work, and how many distinct items they can bring back. Workers will go 'away' after you assign them and press 'next hour', and you won't be able to reassign them until they come back. Bear in mind, they will keep going out and coming back throughout the day depending on the time it takes to do their job.

**Inventory**

Dealing with items is an important part of the game. You will need to manage your carry weight carefully, and might have to drop items you don't need in order to be able to relocate to other areas.

You can use the directional arrows or WASD to navigate through the inventory, as it has 'pages' instead of showing the entire thing at once. On some items, you have the option to 'unpack' them. E.g. unpack a box of nails and get 100 individual nails. Items in the inventory are sorted by rarity and then alphabetical.

**Crafting**

Crafting is another soon-to-be large portion of the game (as soon as more recipes are done). The menu can be navigated in much the same way. Recipes will only be shown if you have at least one relevant ingredient, or you've favourited it (which can be done by pressing 'f' with a craft selected).

Queue crafts to be made with + and - and assign crafters to work on the queue with 'e'. You'll only need one at the start of the game, generally, and only when you have things to craft. Since crafters don't go 'away', you can reassign them at any time.

**Exploring**

You have an initial location, and the efficiency of jobs depends on the location as well. It might be a town center, which is harder to forage in but allows you to 'scavenge' and 'loot', or it might be a field which is great for foraging but not much else. Each location has a 'next' location that's linked to it and can be explored, which will scout the area. When scouting hits 100%, you can relocate to it and reap its benefits fully.

# Lore

In 2050, a combination of pandemic, resource wars and finally, a global 'nano-EMP' brought humanity to its knees in what became known as the Omega Event. Over half of the globe was rendered sterile (or killed outright) by a disease known as Yuanbao, while the remainder suffered birth defects causing death or deformity. In the powerless panic, cities were scattered and strange AI gods were buried.

By this point, however, humans were not the only sapient race, for some genetic experements called 'Reynards' after the folklore character had been made from uplifting the common red fox in England. Originally having been devised for either military or civilian applications, during this Omega Event of global catastrophe, they were able to band together and free themselves. They restyled their common name to 'Provani' after their first liberator 'Lee', and prepared to start a new life free of human contraints.

The year is 2060, and this small group of leeani you lead in LOORDS OF ANGLEE may rise to become a powerful state in post-OE England. It is a time of upheaval and reformation.
